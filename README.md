The 3-tier architecture is a commonly used approach for building scalable and reliable web applications. In this architecture, the application is broken down into three distinct layers or tiers, each of which serves a specific purpose:

Presentation tier: The presentation tier is the topmost layer of the application and is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) to the user. This tier is usually implemented as a web server and serves static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Application tier: The application tier is the middle layer of the application and is responsible for processing user requests and generating dynamic content. This tier contains the business logic of the application and interacts with the data tier to fetch and manipulate data.

Data tier: The data tier is the bottommost layer of the application and is responsible for storing and managing data. This tier is typically implemented using a relational or NoSQL database.

Now, let's see how this architecture is implemented on AWS:

Presentation tier: To implement the presentation tier, you can use Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) that can serve static content from edge locations around the world, ensuring low latency and high performance. You can also use Amazon S3 to store and serve static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Application tier: To implement the application tier, you can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances running behind a load balancer. You can use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or AWS Lambda to deploy containerized or serverless applications.

Data tier: To implement the data tier, you can use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for relational databases or Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL databases. You can also use Amazon Elasticache for
